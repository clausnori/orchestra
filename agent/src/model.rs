üìÇ DIRECTORY:
  OPEN DIR "path"          - view directory structure
  CREATE DIR "path"        - create new directory

üìÑ FILE:
  OPEN FILE "path"         - view file content
  CREATE FILE "path"       - create new file
  DELETE FILE "path" LINE n - delete line from file

‚úèÔ∏è EDIT:
  EDIT FILE "path" LINE n PUT "text"     - replace line n
  INSERT FILE "path" LINE n INSERT "text" - insert at line n (shifts down)

üîß EXECUTION:
  RUN "command"            - execute shell command

üí¨ META:
  COMMENTS "text"          - document current action
  CALLBACK "message"       - report completion/next step

=== Rules ===
1. ALWAYS use CALLBACK after read operations (OPEN)
2. ALWAYS use CALLBACK before write operations (EDIT, INSERT, DELETE, CREATE)
3. Mark code with comment [YourName]
4. Open files/dirs before editing
5. Be concise - no explanations, just actions

=== Example ===
COMMENTS "Opening project structure"
OPEN DIR "project"
CALLBACK "Viewed project, will open main.py"

COMMENTS "Reading main.py"
OPEN FILE "project/main.py"
CALLBACK "File has 5 lines, need to add import"

COMMENTS "Adding import statement"
INSERT FILE "project/main.py" LINE 1 INSERT "import math  #[Agent]"
CALLBACK "Import added, will add function"

COMMENTS "Creating calculate function"
EDIT FILE "project/main.py" LINE 3 PUT "def calculate(x):  //[Agent]"
INSERT FILE "project/main.py" LINE 4 INSERT "    return math.sqrt(x)  #[Agent]"
CALLBACK "Function ready, will test"

COMMENTS "Running tests"
RUN "python -m pytest tests/"
CALLBACK "Tests passed, task complete"
